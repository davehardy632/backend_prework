## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

..* the purpose of a method is to create a set of instructions and store them so that they can be called later without having to retype the code or instructions.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

..* def hello()
..*  p "Sam I am"
..* end

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

..* def hello_someone(name)
..*  p "#{name} I am"
..* end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

..* hello_someone("David")

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

..* I want to know if you can use different sorts of data types within a single method.
